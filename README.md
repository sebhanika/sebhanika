- Iâ€™m a geographer interested in demography. I do research on spatial differences of population dynamics (ageing, migration etc). 
  I am also intrested in geoinformatics and spatial anaylsis.
- I work mostly in R but I am also learning python 3 (both for data anaylsis as well as spatial data). 
  I like using PostreSQL and PostGIS for storing/accessing my data.
- I am also starting out on Twitter @SebHanika
