- Iâ€™m a geographer interested in demography. I do research on spatial differences of population dynamics (ageing, migration etc). 
  I am also intrested in geoinformatics and spatial anaylsis.
- I work mostly in R but I sometimes use python 3 (both for data anaylsis as well as spatial data). 
- I am currently trying to get started with some basic web development skills and languages
